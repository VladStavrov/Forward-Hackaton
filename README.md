# Forward-Hackaton

Welcome to the Forward-Hackaton repository!

We are a team participating in a web3 application development hackathon. Our theme is to create a crowdfunding platform. We aim to develop an innovative solution that allows users to create and support their own crowdfunding projects.

To review our progress on Checkpoint #1, please follow the link to our Google Docs: [Checkpoint #1 Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m-dAice44uD48PZF53rWinej_RXuBy6fGPS0QO-IOCw/edit?usp=sharing)
